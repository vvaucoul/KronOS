## Virtual File System (VFS) Cache - Documentation

### Overview

The Virtual File System (VFS) Cache is an integral part of VFS, designed to optimize filesystem operations. This subsystem effectively manages nodes within the VFS, enhancing both access times and efficiency.

### Key Components

`VfsCache`

- Serves as the main structure for the VFS cache.
- Holds the root node, count of nodes, and cache functions.

`VfsCacheLinks`

- Represents the relationship between VFS nodes and the cache.
- Contains pointers to the VFS node, its cache, parent, and children nodes.

`VfsCacheFn`

- Defines operations to manipulate cache links within nodes.
- Includes functions for setting and getting cache links.

### VFS Cache Architecture

The VFS Cache is designed to provide a quick and efficient way to access and manage filesystem nodes. It stores nodes in a hierarchical structure, allowing for faster lookup and management operations.

### Functionalities

- Node Caching: Enhances performance by caching filesystem nodes.
- Hierarchy Management: Maintains a hierarchical structure of nodes, including parent and child relationships.
- Dynamic Expansion: Allows dynamic addition and removal of nodes in the cache.

### Implementation Steps

1. Define VFS Cache Fn Structures:
   - VfsCacheFn provides functions for manipulating cache links.
   - Create both functions for setting and getting cache links. (`vfs_set_cache_links`, `vfs_get_cache_links`)
2. Call `vfs_create_cache` to initialize the VFS cache.
   - This function creates the root node and sets the cache functions to `VFS`.
3. It's done! The VFS cache is now ready to be used. (easy, right?)

## Code Integration

```c
#include "vfs.h"

// Initialize VFS Cache
VfsCacheFn vfsCacheFn = {vfs_set_cache_links, vfs_get_cache_links};

// Initialize VFS with filesystem details
Vfs *vfs = vfs_create(&myFsInfo, &myFsOps, &myNodeOps); // See vfs.md for details

// Create VFS Cache
VfsCache vfsCache = vfs_create_cache(vfs, &vfsCacheFn);
```

### Conclusion

The VFS Cache is a vital component for optimizing file system operations in VFS. It provides an efficient way to manage the filesystem's nodes, significantly improving access and modification operations. With its hierarchical structure and dynamic node management, the VFS Cache plays a crucial role in the performance and scalability of the file system.
