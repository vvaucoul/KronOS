# ATA Driver Documentation

## Introduction
ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) is a common interface standard for connecting storage devices, such as hard drives and CD-ROM drives, to a computer.
This documentation describes the functionality of the ATA driver.

## Architecture
A computer can connect to multiple hard drives via ATA controllers. Each ATA controller can manage two hard drives - one master and one slave - through an ATA ribbon cable. Here is a representation of this configuration:

```PlainText
Computer
  |
  |---ATA Controller 1
  |     |
  |     |---Rubbon cable ATA 1
  |     |     |
  |     |     |---Hard disk 1 (Master)
  |     |     |
  |     |     |---Hard disk 2 (Slave)
  |
  |---ATA Controller 2
        |
        |---Rubbon cable ATA 2
              |
              |---Hard disk 3 (Master)
              |
              |---Hard disk 4 (Slave)
```


## Operation of the ATA Driver
The ATA driver is responsible for communication between the computer and the hard drives via ATA controllers. It sends commands to the hard drives by writing to specific registers and reads responses from the hard drives by reading the same registers.

Here are some of the main functions of the ATA driver:

- `ata_select_drive(ATADevice* dev)`: Selects the hard drive to communicate with (master or slave) on the specified ATA controller.
- `ata_wait_ready(ATADevice* dev)`: Waits for the selected hard drive to be ready to receive commands.
- `ata_drive_is_present(ATADevice* dev)`: Checks if the selected hard drive is present and ready to receive commands.

## Conclusion
The ATA driver is an essential component to enable a computer to communicate with its hard drives. It manages the complexity of the ATA interface, allowing the rest of the system to interact with hard drives as if they were simple and linear storage devices.
